# Deforestation_Analysis

This Google Earth Engine (GEE) code performs a comprehensive analysis of deforestation for the period 2013 to 2022 in a specified study area. The code utilizes Landsat imagery and applies cloud masking techniques to generate yearly composites. Subsequently, it calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and classifies deforestation based on a defined NDVI threshold.
